# OKPCA
This repository contains MATLAB code for principal component analysis of continuous-time trajectories using occupation kernels. The code implements the methods described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11138

Several examples that illustrate the use of the methods are also available in the Examples folder.

Compatibility: MATLAB R2020b or newer.

The HoffmanKPCA folder contains slightly modified version of Hoffman's KPCA code from https://www.heikohoffmann.de/kpca/kpca.zip. This code is used for the numerical comparisons presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11138.
